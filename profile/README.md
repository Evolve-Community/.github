    <strong>A research DAO to build world-changing projects together on the internet computer.</strong>
</p>
<br>

Evolve is a (soon to be) DAO where web3 developers, researchers, entrepreneurs, moonshot thinkers come together to build world-changing projects on an infinite world computer. 

You can create your own projects as though it were your own personal computer and deploy it directly. You can also participate by suggesting improvements and collaborating on various research projects.
