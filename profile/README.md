## 🌌 What is Evolve Network?
Evolve Network is a decentralized compute platform designed to democratize AI agent creation. It enables anyone to build and run AI agents on a peer-to-peer distributed GPU network, ensuring accessibility, transparency, and collective intelligence. 

## 🌍 Why Evolve Network?
AI has reached a pivotal point where large language models (LLMs) are shaping the future of intelligence. However, their development and access remain centralized—restricted to entities with massive compute infrastructure. Evolve Network challenges this status quo by offering a **decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN)** that distributes AI workloads across a network of participants, enabling:

- **Open access to AI models** (e.g., Llama 3, Mixtral) via a decentralized GPU grid.
- **Multi-agent AI workflows**, where AI agents collaborate to perform complex tasks autonomously.
- **A community-driven model**, where users contribute compute, data, and tools to refine AI systems.

## 🔍 Key Components

### **1️⃣ Agents Studio**
A powerful and intuitive interface to create and orchestrate AI agents. Users can build custom multi-agent workflows simply by describing their goals in natural language. Agents can autonomously execute tasks, interact with APIs, and learn over time.

**Features:**
- No-code agent creation via conversation-based workflow.
- Community-driven **Agent Hub** to share and monetize agent designs.
- Automatic tool integration for API-based operations.

### **2️⃣ Data Hub**
AI models are only as useful as the context they understand. The **Data Hub** lets users upload their data (text, images, documents) to personalize AI agents and align responses to their preferences.

**Key Benefits:**
- Users can create a **"digital brain"**, fine-tuning AI models with personal knowledge.
- Enhanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for precise and context-aware responses.
- Enabling **user-controlled AI alignment**, where models evolve with individual needs.

### **3️⃣ Decentralized Compute Nodes**
Evolve Network operates on a **peer-to-peer distributed compute layer**, where participants (nodes) provide GPU resources to host and run AI models.

**How it works:**
- **Nodes contribute VRAM and processing power** to run sharded AI workloads.
- **Token incentives** ensure fair rewards based on uptime, computational capacity, and task completion.
- **Privacy-focused infrastructure** using **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** to ensure data security.

## 🏗️ Current Development Status
- ✅ **Agents Studio** is live – users can create agents with memory and logic.
- ✅ **Data Hub** is operational – upload documents and interact with AI using contextualized knowledge.
- 🛠️ **Node Software** is in final development – allowing users to host models for decentralized inference.

## 🏛️ Governance & Decentralization
Evolve Network follows a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** model where token holders can:
- Vote on protocol upgrades and network improvements.
- Propose new AI features, integrations, and incentive structures.
- Participate in governance by staking **EVOLVE** tokens.

## 💰 Tokenomics
The **EVOLVE** token powers the ecosystem:
- **Total Supply**: 42 billion
- **Initial Circulating Supply**: 8.4 billion at **TGE** (Token Generation Event)
- **Node Rewards**: Tokens distributed to compute providers.
- **Marketplace Utility**: Tokens are used for AI agent transactions and incentives.

## 🚀 The Future of Evolve Network
Evolve Network is more than just a decentralized AI platform. It represents a vision for **collective intelligence**—where AI systems evolve alongside humanity in an open, transparent, and collaborative manner.

Future plans include:
- **Expanding agent capabilities** with multi-modal AI models.
- **Fine-tuning LLMs on personalized data** for user-controlled AI alignment.
- **Humanoid robotics integration**, bridging digital intelligence with real-world physical systems.
